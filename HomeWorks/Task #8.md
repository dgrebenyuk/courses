### Overview
After login user should be redirected to page with newsfeed (something like vk or facebook have) form in the top
and posts (latest posts first). Use bootstrap components for better look.

### Requirements
* Form should have only `Title` and `Body` fields. Please ignore `published_at` for now.
* Posts should be added via AJAX
* Each post entry should show Title, Body, Author full name and created_at date in next format **(April 14, 2017)**
* If you are the author of post you should see `Delete` button near it. (*Hint use `current_user` object to detect this*)
* `Delete` also should work with AJAX


**NOTE:** also please attach some screenshots with your code changes (slack attachments will be ok)
