### Overview
Implement drag & drop sorting

### Implementation Steps
1. Clone <https://github.com/dgrebenyuk/practical_app>
2. Setup it on your local machines (bundle, migrations, seeds)
3. Go to <http://localhost:3000/items> (you should see some data there)
4. Use jQuery UI and add ability to sort items in table
5. Create new branch with your surname and push results to it. When you are happy with results then open PR to master branch.
